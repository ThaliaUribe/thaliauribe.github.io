Hello World! My name is Thalia and I'm a 27 years old Mexican Lawyer with US citizenship. 
I'm doing something new and it's all about mixing law and technology.
I was born in Orange County, California but raised in Mexico City. 
My first shore in this page is to put a kitten gif. (I know... but, well... I'm a newbie)
